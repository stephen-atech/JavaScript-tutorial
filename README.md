# JavaScript-tutorial
This repo is to document my leaning journey of JavaScript 

# Data Types
- Undefined : ANything that hasnt been defined.
- null : Nothing.
- boolean : True or False.
- string : Text.
- symbol : A unique value.
- number : An integer or a number.
- object : It can store key value pairs.

# Variables 
- Data is set to or as variables.
- A lable to point to anyting it has been assigned to.

# Variable Declearation 
- These are variables the are decleared but have not been assigned a value
- var, let and const are the ways to declear variables in Javascript
- var : It works in the global scope of the program, it can work anywhere 
- let : It works in the local scope of the program, it only works in the scope it was decleared 
- const : It's value when assigned can never be changed
eg: 
   var a; 
   let b; 
   const c;

# Vsrible Assignment 
- This is when the variable decleared is giving a value
eg: 
   var a = 1; 
   let b = 2; 
   const c = 3;

# Loging 
- console.log() : this is a function for checking the values of variables or loging data in the console.

# Case Senitivity in Variables
- Varible and function names in Javascript are case sensitve
eg:
   var UserName; is not equal to var USERNAME
   ie, the are two different variables
- NB : Camel case is mostly used in Javascript variable declearations
eg:
   var userName;
   var studentDetails;

# Adding Numbers
- Adding numbers in Javascript is done using the '+' opperator
eg:
   var sum = 10 + 10;

# Subtracting Numbers
- Subtraction in Javascript is done using the '-' opperator
eg:
   var sub = 30 - 10;

# Multiplying Numbers
- Multiplication in Javascript is done using the '*' opperator
eg:
   var sum = 10 * 2;

# Dividing Nubers 
- Division in Javascript is done using the '/' opperator
eg:
   var div = 40 / 2;

# Incrementing Numbers 
- Increaseing numbers in Javascript is done by adding 1 or uing the '++'
eg:
   var inc = 19;
   inc = inc++ or inc = inc + 1

# Decrementing Numbers 
- Decreaseing numbers in Javascript is done by subtracting 1 or uing the '--'
eg:
   var dec = 21;
   dec = dec-- or dec = dec - 1

# Decimal Numbers
- They are refered to as Floating Point Numbers or Floats
eg:
   var ourDecimal = 5.7;
   var myDecimal = 0.009;

# Multiplying Decimal Numbers
- Multiplying Decimals is equal to multiplying whole numbers 
eg:
   var product = 2.0 * 2.5;
