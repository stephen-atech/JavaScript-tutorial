# JavaScript-tutorial
This repo is to document my leaning journey of JavaScript 

# Data Types
- Undefined : ANything that hasnt been defined.
- null : Nothing.
- boolean : True or False.
- string : Text.
- symbol : A unique value.
- number : An integer or a number.
- object : It can store key value pairs.

# Variables 
- Data is set to or as variables.
- A lable to point to anyting it has been assigned to.

# Variable Declearation 
- var, let and const are the ways to declear variables in Javascript
- var : It works in the global scope of the program, it can work anywhere 
- let : It works in the local scope of the program, it only works in the scope it was decleared 
- const : It's value when assigned can never be changed
eg: 
   var a; 
   let b; 
   const c;

# Vsrible Assignment 
- This is when the variable b=decleared is giving a value
eg: 
   var a = 1; 
   let b = 2; 
   const c = 3;

# Loging 
- console.log() : this is a function for checking the values of variables or loging data in the console.
